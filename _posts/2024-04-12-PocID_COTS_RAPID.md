# DNA Extraction  

DNA was extracted with[Zymo Research Quick-DNA™ 96 Kit D3010](https://github.com/hputnam/Putnam_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/images/_d3010_d3011_d3012_quick-dna_96_kit.pdf) 

Used Page 10 [Proteinase K Digestino with DNA/RNA Shield](https://github.com/hputnam/Putnam_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/images/20240411_ZymoQuickDNA96_notes.jpg?raw=true)

Used [Eppendorf Deepwell Plate 96/2000 µL plates Catalog No. 951033502](https://www.eppendorf.com/us-en/eShop-Products/Laboratory-Consumables/Plates/Eppendorf-Deepwell-Plates-p-951033502) for reagent and sample mixing prior to adding to Zymo column plate

Need Proteinase K with Storage Buffer (Zymo D3001-2-20) and PK Digestion Buffer (Zymo R1200-1-20)

For each of 3 tubes of Proteinase K with Storage Buffer (Zymo D3001-2-20) I added 1040µl of Proteinas K Storage Buffer to lyophilized Proteinase K 20mg tube and mixed by vortex.



- First 150µl of new DNA/RNA Shield was added to each well in the Eppendorf 96 Deepwell plate

- Next 30µl of PK Digestion buffer and 15µl of resusdended Proteinase K solution was added to each well.

- Next 150µl of sample added to each well and samples were mixed with solution.

The samples were extracted according to the manufacturer’s instructions for the Quick DNA 96 Kit for samples stored in DNA/RNA Shield including the addition of 15µl of Proteinase K (20mg ml-1). 


Zymo Kit Genomic Lysis Buffer was prepared according to [Instructions Page 4](https://github.com/hputnam/Putnam_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/images/_d3010_d3011_d3012_quick-dna_96_kit.pdf). 500µl of beta-mercaptoethanol was added to the 100ml bottle of Genomic Lysis Buffer. 


- Next 4 volumes of Zymo Kit Genomic Lysis Buffer was added for each volume of the sample digestion (e.g., add 1200µl of Genomic Lysis Buffer to 300µl of sample digestion). Samples were mixed via pipetting and the mixutres were incubated for 5 minutes at room temperature. 

### MASSIVE PROBLEM HERE IN ZYMO INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE KIT INSTRUCTIONS PROVIDED. THERE IS ONLY 100ML OF GENOMIC LYSIS BUFFER PROVIDED, BUT THE KIT INSTRUCTIONS DO NOT TELL YOU TO ORDER MORE PRIOR TO STARTING THE KIT. THEREFORE WE WERE LEFT WITH NO GENOMIC LYSIS BUFFER FOR COLUMNS 11 AND 12 OF PLATE 001. THEREFORE WE MOVED FORWARD WITH EXTRACTIONS OF 80 SAMPLES FROM PLATE 001 COLUMNS 1-10 ALL ROWS. COLUMNS 11 AND 12 WERE MOVED TO NEW INDIVIDUALLY LABELLED TUBES AND STORED IN THE -20°C FREEZER.

![Page 10 of kit protocol](https://github.com/hputnam/Putnam_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/images/20240411_ZymoQuickDNA96_notes.jpg?raw=true)

Each well of the Silicon-A plate set on the collection plate can hold 600µl, but this brings the liquid too close to the top and increases chances of carry over to other wells. Becasue of this, I added the sample in 4 steps: 
1) 400µl and then 5 minute spin at 1000 rcf
1) 400µl and then 5 minute spin at 1000 rcf
1) 400µl and then 5 minute spin at 2500 rcf
1) 400µl and then 5 minute spin at 2500 rcf

The waste was removed from the collection plate after each centrifugation step. 

- Next 200µl of DNA Pre-wash buffer was added to each well and then the plate was spun for 5 minute at 2500 rcf

- Next 300µl of g-DNA wash buffer was added to each well and then the plate was spun for 5 minute at 2500 rcf

- DNA was then eluted in 60µl of kit Elution Buffer warmed to 70°C. DNA extractions were completed on 11 April 2024 and DNA stored at -20°C in the elution plate covered with a foil seal.

# PCR
## Prepare Reagents
Primers - [Flot et al. 2008](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1631069107003812?via%3Dihub)   
- Forward primer FatP6.1	(Added 50µl of stock 2mg/ml plus 950µl of Nuclease Free water and made 3 aliquots of ~320µl each and stored in reagent box at -20)   
- FatP6.1 (5′-TTTGGGSATTCGTTTAGCAG-3′)    
- Reverse primer RORF	(Added 50µl of stock 2mg/ml plus 950µl of Nuclease Free water and made 3 aliquots of ~320µl each and stored in reagent box at -20)

**EmeraldAmp GT PCR Master Mix was recieved warm on arrival and stored at -20°C**

# EmeraldAmp GT PCR Master Mix (2x)

24µl added to each of 82 wells. The total master mix was not enough and 2 more wells needed to be generated individually (H8 and H9). Next time add more for pipette loss.
