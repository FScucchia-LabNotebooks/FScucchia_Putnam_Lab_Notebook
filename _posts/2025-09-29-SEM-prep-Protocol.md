#### Preparing skeleton samples for scanning electron microscope

1. Bleach the skeleton overnight, same method used for airbrushing.
2. Let the skeleton dry, then cut the skeleton into fragments that fit the SEM stubs.
3. Mount skeleton fragment onto one stub using the black adhesive tape.
4. Put the mounted sample under vacuum for at elast a couple days. This is a picture of the set up for the vacuum:

5. Store in the SEM box before imaging.
