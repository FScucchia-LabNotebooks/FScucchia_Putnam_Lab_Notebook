#### Measuring concentration of Symbiodiniaceae cells using the GUAVA instrument

**Instrument details**
This protocol refers to the Millipore Guava easyCyte HT Flow Cytometer located at the URI Coastal Institute Building (Bay Campus).

**Sample Preparation**  
1. Thaw coral homogenate aliquot (650uL) and vortex sample for 15 seconds.
2. To separate host and algae, centrifuge the 1.5 tube for 4 minutes at 5000rpm at 4°C. 
3. Remove the supernatant (host tissue) work with pellet (algae).
4. Resuspend the algae with 650uL 1XPBS and homogenize.
5. Centrifuge for 5 minutes at 5000rpm at 4°C.
6. Remove the supernatant. 
7. Resuspend the algae with 650uL PBS and homogenize.
8. Centrifuge for 5 minutes at 5000rpm at 4°C.
9. Remove the supernatant thoroughly
10. Resuspend the algae with 650uL PBS and homogenize. Freeze and store. 

_Note_: You want to make sure that the samples is free of host remainings and dirt, which may clog the GUAVA.
