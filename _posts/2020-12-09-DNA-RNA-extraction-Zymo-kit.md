category: Extraction
tags: [ RNA, DNA, Zymo ]
---

Using the [Zymo Quick-DNA/RNA Miniprep Plus Kit](https://www.zymoresearch.com/collections/quick-dna-rna-kits/products/quick-dna-rna-miniprep-plus-kit) on adult coral fragments.
This protocol is based off of the protocol of [Zoe Dellaert](https://zdellaert.github.io/ZD_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/Protocols_Zymo_Quick_DNA_RNA_Miniprep_Plus/)
with some adjustments by me.

### Reagents preparation (first time opening the kit)

1. Add 96 mL 100% ethanol (104 mL 95% ethanol) to the 24 mL DNA/RNA Wash Buffer concentrate before use. DNA/RNA Wash Buffer included with D7003T (Mini Prep Plus Kit) is supplied ready-to-use and does not require the addition of ethanol prior to use. Check kit contents and instructions to confirm prep steps.  
2. Reconstitute the lyophilized (freeze-dried) DNase I as indicated on the vial prior to use. Mix by inversion. Store frozen aliquots.  
3. Reconstitute the lyophilized (freeze-dried) Proteinase K as indicated on the vial prior to use. For 20g Proteinase K, add 1040 uL Proteinase K Storage Buffer. For 5 mg Proteinase K, add 260 uL Proteinase K Storage Buffer. Mix by vortexing. Check kit contents and instructions to confirm prep steps. Store tube at -20 ºC, no need to aliquot.

###  Sterilizing working area to maintain an RNAse-free environment
Clean bench with clean paper towels (spray solution, wipe down) in the following order:
10% bleach solution
DI water
70% ethanol
RNAse cleaner (spray bottle)
Clean pipettes, tip boxes, and the controls on the heating block and centrifuge by squirting 70% ethanol on a paper towel and wiping them down. Repeat with RNAse cleaner. Wipe down gloves with 70% ethanol and RNAse cleaner. Do not spray solutions directly on the equipment.

### Sample preparation: 
#### Adult Fragment Sample stored in Zymo DNA/RNA Shield
This protocol utilizes coral clippings stored in 1mL of Zymo DNA/RNA shield and kept at -80 ºC. Thaw samples to room temperature on benchtop. On a clean work surface (see above), stand up the tubes in numerical order and photograph to record qualitative qualities such as buffer color and amount of tissue in tube.

##### Notes on sample preparation
This protocol will start by taking 300 uL of the DNA/RNA shield from the sample tube into a clean 1.5 mL tube and performing a Proteinase K digestion in a new tube. However, there are several adjustments that can be made at this step.

- If the DNA/RNA shield looks very dark (ex: this occurs a lot with highly pigmented species such as Porites spp.), only take 150 or 100 uL of the DNA/RNA shield from the sample tube into the new tube and dilute with 150 uL or 200 uL of clean DNA/RNA shield (provided in kit). Proceed as directed.

- If the extraction is not yielding enough DNA or RNA and the DNA/RNA shield looks very light-colored, it could be that the lytic properties of the DNA/RNA shield did not break up the tissue enough to yield enough DNA and RNA from the buffer alone. In this case, you could bead beat this sample using the protocols described by other lab members Emma L. Strand, Dr. Kevin H. Wong, and Kristina Terpis. This bead beating step could be done by adding beads to the original sample tube, or by transferring an aliquot (300 uL) of the DNA/RNA shield from the sample tube along with a clipping of the tissue fragment into a new bead tube. Add 500-700 uL of clean DNA/RNA shield to make up 800 uL - 1 mL for bead-beating and bead beat for 1-2 minutes at maximum speed. Then, centrifuge briefly and take an aliquot of 300 uL from this homogenized mixture into a clean 1.5 mL tube. Proceed as directed.

#### Adult Fragment Sample flash frozen, not stored in Zymo DNA/RNA Shield
With sterilized clippers (10% bleach, DEPC water, 70% ethanol, air-dried), cut small (5mm x 5mm) fragments from the frozen sample into a clean 1.5 mL screw-cap tube with 1000 uL DNA/RNA shield and 0.25 mL of 0.5mm glass beads, Work on ice (better if dry ice). Sterilize clippers between each sample.
- Note: for species with a lot of mucus, like _Montipora capitata_, I used 1300 uL of DNA/RNA shield to try to dilute as much as possible the mucus and avoid getting it into the extraction column.
Bead beat for 1-2 minutes on the vortex at max speed. 
Briefly spin down and remove 400 uL of supernatant into a clean tube. Spin for 3-4 mins at 9,000 rcf.
Put original samples and bead tubes back in -80 ºC freezer.
Remove 300 uL of the supernatant into a new tube and continue on with the protocol below (from the Pro K step) as written.

### Proteinase K Digestion
Add: 30 µl of PK digestion buffer to each 300 uL sample tube (1:10 ratio of PK Digestion Buffer:Sample)
Add: 15 µl Proteinase K to each (1:2 ratio of Proteinase K:PK Digestion Buffer).
Invert 3x to mix.
Vortex and spin down.
Place original sample tubes back in the freezer box (in -80 ºC) that they came from. Always keep these as backup.

30. Store all tubes in the -80°C

### DNA and RNA quantity and quality  
- Follow Broad Range dsDNA and RNA Qubit protocol to analyze sample quantity. Read standards once and record values, read all samples twice.
- Run DNA and RNA samples on an agarose gel
- If RNA quantity is sufficient (for sequencing you need to have a total of 500 ng per sample), determine RNA quality using the Tape Station. "Good" RNA should have a RIN above 8.0 and form two distinct peaks at the 18S and 28S locations.
