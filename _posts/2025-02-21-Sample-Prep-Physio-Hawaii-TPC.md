#### Preparing Coral Homogenate for Physiological Analyses for the Hawaii TPC ENCORE project

**Protocols used**
- [Airbrushing protocol](https://zdellaert.github.io/ZD_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/Physiology-Airbrushing-Protocol/)

I followed the above protocol to separate the tissue from the skeleton, which will then be used for surface area measurements using the wax-dipping method.
I divided the tissue homogenate into aliquots as follows (aliquots were then stored at -20° or -80°):

- Chlorophyll and Symbiont Density - 1.5 ml
- Protein - 1.5 ml
- Lipids - 1.5 ml
- Carbohydrates - 1.5 ml
- Spare - 1.5 ml + 5 ml (if enough tissue)

**Sample list**
Here is the list of samples that were processed:

| Date || Sample name || Temp Cat || Volum of PBS added (ml) |
|      ||             ||          ||                         |
|      ||             ||          ||                         |
