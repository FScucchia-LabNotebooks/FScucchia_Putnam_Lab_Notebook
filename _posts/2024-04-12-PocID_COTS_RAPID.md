# DNA Extraction  

DNA was extracted with[Zymo Research Quick-DNA™ 96 Kit D3010](x) 

First 200µl of DNA/RNA Shield (Zymo Research Cat # R1100-250) containing the lysed sample was moved to a new microfuge tube and mixed with 200µl of new DNA/RNA Shield. The samples were extracted according to the manufacturer’s instructions for samples stored in DNA/RNA Shield including the addition of 20µl of Proteinase K (20mg ml-1). Samples were eluted in 50µl of kit Elution Buffer warmed to 65°C and DNA was assessed with a 1.5% agarose gel in 1x TAE buffer (Tris base, acetic acid and EDTA) run at for 45 mins at 100 V and stained with Biotium GelGreen Nucleic Acid Gel Stain (10,000X in Water Fisher Cat NC9728313). 

DNA extractions were completed on 11 April 2024 and DNA stored at -20°C

- Forward primer FatP6.1	(Added 50µl of stock 2mg/ml plus 950µl of Nuclease Free water and made 3 aliquots of ~320µl each and stored in reagent box at -20)   
- FatP6.1 (5′-TTTGGGSATTCGTTTAGCAG-3′)    
- Reverse primer RORF	(Added 50µl of stock 2mg/ml plus 950µl of Nuclease Free water and made 3 aliquots of ~320µl each and stored in reagent box at -20)     
- RORF (5′-SCCAATATGTTAAACASCATGTCA-3′)    
- Master Mix [EmeraldAmp GT PCR Master Mix]()
- ```EmeraldAmp GT PCR Master Mix is a loading-dye-added version of EmeraldAmp MAX PCR Master Mix that is optimized for great performance and convenience in both standard and high-throughput PCR applications.```
**EmeraldAmp GT PCR Master Mix was recieved warm on arrival and stored at -20°C**

# EmeraldAmp GT PCR Master Mix (2x)
## Master Mix: For 82 rxns +3 = 85 

Reagent | 1Rxn µl | 85 Rxn µl |

24µl added to each of 82 wells. The total master mix was not enough and 2 more wells needed to be generated individually (H8 and H9). Next time add more for pipette loss.

## Thermal Cycling Conditions 
- [94°C 60 secondes] 1 cycle
- [94°C 30 sec,53°C 30 sec, 72°C 75 sec] 30 cycles
- [72°C 5 minutes] 1 cycle
- [4°C infinity]

## PCR Gel protocol
prepared a 1.5% gel by mixing 150ml of 1xTAE + 2.25g Agarose, melted gel  in the microwave and let cool and added 5µl Gelgreen and let harden. Ran gel at 66V 100mA for 40 minutes in 1x TAE.
