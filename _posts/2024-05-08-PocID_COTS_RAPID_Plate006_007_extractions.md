## Plate preparation Plate 006 and Plate 007
Moved 100µl of sample liquid (lysed sample in Zymo RNA/DNA Shield) to deep well 96 eppendorf plate. 

#### Samples

## DNA Extraction  

DNA was extracted with[Zymo Research Quick-DNA™ 96 Kit D3010](https://github.com/hputnam/Putnam_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/images/_d3010_d3011_d3012_quick-dna_96_kit.pdf) 

Used Page 10 [Proteinase K Digestion with DNA/RNA Shield](https://github.com/hputnam/Putnam_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/images/20240411_ZymoQuickDNA96_notes.jpg?raw=true)

Used [Eppendorf Deepwell Plate 96/2000 µL plates Catalog No. 951033502](https://www.eppendorf.com/us-en/eShop-Products/Laboratory-Consumables/Plates/Eppendorf-Deepwell-Plates-p-951033502) for reagent and sample mixing prior to adding to Zymo column plate

The samples were extracted according to the manufacturer’s instructions for the Quick DNA 96 Kit for samples stored in DNA/RNA Shield including the addition of Proteinase K (20mg ml-1). 

Added 100µl of sample + 10µl of PK Digestion Buffer + 5µl of ProteinaseK. Pipetted to mix and incubated for 5 min at room temp. 

- 4 volumes of Zymo Kit Genomic Lysis Buffer was added for each volume of the sample digestion (e.g., add 400µl of Genomic Lysis Buffer to 100µl of sample digestion). Samples were mixed via pipetting and the mixtures were incubated for 5 minutes at room temperature.  Then samples were moved to the silicon-A plate columns. I added 400µl and then 5 minute spin at 2500 rcf.

- Next 200µl of DNA Pre-wash buffer was added to each well and then the silicon-A plate was spun for 5 minute at 2500 rcf

	- used sterile 25 or 50ml plastic troughs and multi-channel pipettes
	- 192 samples x 200µl = 38.4ml
 	- The waste was removed from the collection plate after this centrifugation step.  


- Next 300µl of g-DNA wash buffer was added to each well and then the silicon-A plate was spun for 5 minute at 2500 rcf
 	- used sterile 25 or 50ml plastic troughs and multi-channel pipettes
	- 192 samples x 300µl = 57.6ml
 	- The waste was kept in the collection plate after this centrifugation step.  

- DNA was then eluted in 50µl of kit Elution Buffer warmed to 70°C after standing on the column for 3-5 minutes. 
 	- used sterile 25 or 50ml plastic troughs and multi-channel pipettes
	- 192 samples x 50µl = 9.6ml

## Quantification of gDNA   
Used Lane lab nanodrop and kit elution buffer as blank to quantify the first column of DNA on the plate. Used 1.5µl of sample

All tested samples had DNA and can move forward for PCR.

gDNA was stored at -20°C in the elution plate covered with a foil seal.
