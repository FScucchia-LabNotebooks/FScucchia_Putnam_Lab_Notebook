#### Using the Zymo-Seq SwitchFree 3′ mRNA Library Kit for in-house library prep of the Hawaii and Bermuda TPC samples
Using the [Zymo-Seq SwitchFree 3′ mRNA Library Kit](https://www.zymoresearch.com/products/zymo-seq-switchfree-3-mrna-library-kit) to try preparing libraries starting from RNA samples exctracted from adult coral fragments from the Hawaii and Bermuda TPC project. RNA extraction post about these extractions can be found [here](https://fscucchia-labnotebooks.github.io/FScucchia_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/DNA-RNA-Hawaii-TPCA/).

For the library prep I followed the protocol of [Jill Ashey](https://github.com/JillAshey/JillAshey_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2024-03-29-Zymo-SwitchFree.md).

**TapeStation**

After the library prep, I run samples on the tapestation (D5000).

| Library prep date  | colony_id  |     Species            | Temp.Cat   |   Tape_Station_conc.   |
| 20241120  |  Pacu-H10    | *Pocillopora acuta*          | 26.8       |  22.1         |
| 20241120  |  Pcomp-E10   | *Porites compressa*          | 26.8     | 6.52          |
