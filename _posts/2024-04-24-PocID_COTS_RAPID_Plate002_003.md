## Plate preparation Plate 003
Moved 100µl of sample liquid (lysed sample in Zymo RNA/DNA Shield) to deep well 96 eppendorf plate. Added 10µl of PK DIgestion buffer and 5µl of ProteinaseK to each well and mixed by pipetting. Sealed plate with a foil cover and placed at -20°C for subsequent extraction.

## DNA Extraction  

DNA was extracted with[Zymo Research Quick-DNA™ 96 Kit D3010](https://github.com/hputnam/Putnam_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/images/_d3010_d3011_d3012_quick-dna_96_kit.pdf) 

Used Page 10 [Proteinase K Digestion with DNA/RNA Shield](https://github.com/hputnam/Putnam_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/images/20240411_ZymoQuickDNA96_notes.jpg?raw=true)

Used [Eppendorf Deepwell Plate 96/2000 µL plates Catalog No. 951033502](https://www.eppendorf.com/us-en/eShop-Products/Laboratory-Consumables/Plates/Eppendorf-Deepwell-Plates-p-951033502) for reagent and sample mixing prior to adding to Zymo column plate

Plate 002 was already prepared in the deep well plate from the[11April2024 Prep](https://hputnam.github.io/Putnam_Lab_Notebook/PocID_COTS_RAPID_Plate001/)

The samples were extracted according to the manufacturer’s instructions for the Quick DNA 96 Kit for samples stored in DNA/RNA Shield including the addition of Proteinase K (20mg ml-1). 

For Plate 002
- 4 volumes of Zymo Kit Genomic Lysis Buffer was added for each volume of the sample digestion (e.g., add 1200µl of Genomic Lysis Buffer to 300µl of sample digestion). Samples were mixed via pipetting and the mixtures were incubated for 5 minutes at room temperature. 

Each well of the Silicon-A plate set on the collection plate can hold 600µl, but this brings the liquid too close to the top and increases chances of carry over to other wells. Becasue of this, I added the sample in 3 steps for Plate 002:   
1) 400µl and then 5 minute spin at 2500 rcf
2) 400µl and then 5 minute spin at 2500 rcf
3) 400µl and then 5 minute spin at 2500 rcf

For Plate 003
Added 100µl of sample + 10µl of PK Digestion Buffer + 5µl of ProteinaseK. Pipetted to mix and incubated for 5 min at room temp. 

- 4 volumes of Zymo Kit Genomic Lysis Buffer was added for each volume of the sample digestion (e.g., add 400µl of Genomic Lysis Buffer to 100µl of sample digestion). Samples were mixed via pipetting and the mixtures were incubated for 5 minutes at room temperature.  Then samples were moved to the plate columns. I added 400µl and then 5 minute spin at 2500 rcf.

The waste was removed from the collection plate after each centrifugation step. 

Once all steps were complete to this point for both Plate 002 and Plate 003, all steps were completed the same for both plates as described below.

- Next 200µl of DNA Pre-wash buffer was added to each well and then the plate was spun for 5 minute at 2500 rcf

- Next 300µl of g-DNA wash buffer was added to each well and then the plate was spun for 5 minute at 2500 rcf

- DNA was then eluted in 50µl of kit Elution Buffer warmed to 70°C. gDNA was stored at -20°C in the elution plate covered with a foil seal.

## Quantification of gDNA   
Used Lane lab nanodrop and kit elution buffer as blank to quantify the first column of DNA on the plate. Used 1.5µl of sample
